Introduction
======
Peakaboo is a software package for analysis of transient absorption (TA) data. It can self-consistently identify spectrally and temporally evolvin signatures of charge carriers after photoexcitation in TA data. With minimal assumption, our algorithm recovers and visualizes the spectral and kinetic information of individual populations by combining methods such as multivariate adaptive regression spline fitting and data clustering.

My Achievments
======
*	Apply ML (machine learning) methods on photovoltaic materials, thus enabling the design of more efficient solar cells.
*	Develop software and attempt to recover spectral and kinetic information of the individual photophysical populations with minimal assumptions.
*	Find places where solar and wind energy can compensate to each other to achieve a stable source of clean energy and use this combinational renewable energy source to replace the local traditional energy supply
