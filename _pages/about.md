Hi ! I'm a current UW master student. Now pursuing MS in Material Engineering along with Data Science certificate program at University of Washington, which equipped me with Interdisciplinary talent of engineering and computer science technology.

I landed my first technical internship during my first year of master in Seattle, creating and develop responsive and friendly user interface and help improve backend service at a start-up company.While I was managing project at intern, I realized that I was very much interested in web programming and wanted to be able to do all of the development myself. I want to be able to build anything I can think of.

After that, I’ve gone on to land many more internships and help more company and client to design and built their own website.

Right now, I’m super passionate about technology and ready to be exposed to more new technologies, use new frameworks, meet new people, and learn new methods of solving problems, and applying modern technologies to my web development stack.
